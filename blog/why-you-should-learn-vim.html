            What is Vim?
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Vim is simply a text editor, as are Sublime Text and VS Code, among others.
            Instead of being an application that you download and run, vim lives in your terminal.
            It's typically operated without the use of a mouse.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Basically, you can use various commands to navigate and edit text. For example,
            the basic navigation commands are:
            <ul class="list" style="list-style: none;">
                <li>
                    <span class="code-inline">h</span> to move cursor left
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="code-inline">j</span> to move cursor down
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="code-inline">k</span> to move cursor up
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="code-inline">l</span> to move cursor right
                </li>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            You can launch vim by going into your terminal and typing <span class="code-inline">
                vim
            </span>.

            What All the Fuss is About
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Although it seems useless at first,
            there are literally <i>countless</i> reasons as to why you should use vim.
            Let me talk about the most glaring ones.
        </div>
        <div class="subheading" id="reason1">
            Reason #1: Productivity
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Because vim is keyboard-only and most of the essential commands can be completed
            using the home row, you end up with <strong>huge</strong> time savings.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            At first it takes some time to get reach your original productivity level,
            but after that, it simply becomes the faster way to write code.
        </div>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-img-content" src="../img/vim-graph.jpeg" alt="Vim productivity graph">
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            It's all about minimizing the time it takes for you to go from thinking
            "I want to do X" to actually doing X on the computer - and vim
            embraces that with open arms.
            You can create your own commands for just about anything.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            As a programmer, you're going to be typing for most of your career.
            Let's say you spend ~4 hours writing code every day.
            If using vim makes you even <span class="code-inline">1.25x</span>
            faster at writing code, <strong>then in 1 year, you will
                comfortably save over 150 hours of your time.</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Combine this with the fact that vim can improve your productivity by much more,
            and extrapolate that over a long career. That's a lot of time.
            Yes - you'll need to
            invest time initially, but the benefits are a lifetime of savings.
        </div>
        <div class="subheading" id="reason2">
            Reason #2: Ergonomics
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            I've quickly come to learn the importance of ergonomics. Wrist injuries can be
            pretty detrimental to a career.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Primarily, moving your hand to reach for your mouse is not only slow, it also puts
            added strain on your
            wrists. Since vim is mouse-less, being able to plant your wrists in one position
            is great for comfort.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Another of the countless examples is that reaching for the arrow keys on a typical keyboard is just
            <i>really</i> awkward. Having navigation (the most common operation) rooted to h, j, k, and l where your
            fingers naturally lie is a lifesaver.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Combine this with an ergonomic keyboard, and you've got a great duo.

        </div>
        <div class="subheading" id="reason3">
            Reason #3: Availability
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Learn it once, use it everywhere! Vim is guaranteed to exist on all Unix systems and
            almost all Linux systems. Need to edit a file through ssh on a server?
            Working on a different machine? It's always there for you ❤️
        </div>
        <div class="subheading" id="reason4">
            Reason #4: Customizability
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Nowadays, most IDEs are highly customizable as well, but vim gives you complete control.
            You can pick which plugins you want and change the behaviour of just about anything.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Many of the popular IDE features like git integration, code completion, and snippets can 
            be added through plugins.
        </div>
        <div class="img-wrapper">

        <div class="blog-section">
            Your vim configeration is specified using a <span class="code-inline">.vimrc</span> file.
            Porting your configeration to a new machine is as simple as copying over this file.
        </div>
        <div class="subheading" id="reason5">
            Reason #5: It's Fun
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Honestly, using vim is fun! It's simply become the more enjoyable way to work.
            I've been using it for years and still am nowhere <i>near</i>
            scratching the surface of its full capabilities. 
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            It's just fun to look for better ways to do things in vim.
            It's a little hard to explain, you need to try it yourself!
        </div>
        <div class="subheading" id="downsides">
            Downsides
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            I dont think vim can completely replace an IDE for some people.
            Certain features are simply easier with an all-out IDE, even
            if they're possible in vim.
            For example, if your workplace uses an IDE, they might build extensions and integrations for
            your work on top of it, which you may miss out on.
            But that's okay - it doesn't have to be your #1 editor to make it worth learning.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            If anything, some IDEs have options to enable vim bindings, so you can use 
            vim-like commands while still using your preferred IDE.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">Also, the productivity hit you take in the first few weeks is
            definitely a downside, but hopefully by now you're convinced of the long-term benefits of
            this one-time investment.

        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            The best way is to simply open your terminal, and run <span class="code-inline">vimtutor</span>.
            It'll walk you through the basics on vim and give you a chance to practice.
        </div>
        <div class="img-wrapper">

        <div class="blog-section">
            When you first start, you'll probably feel a crippling sense of inadequacy.
            What was once so simple is now so difficult... Just stick with it and it'll come
            eventually! 😅
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            After that, I suggest having some <a target="_blank" href="https://vim.rtorr.com">cheat sheets</a>
            handy and working on your <span class="code-inline">.vimrc</span> when you're more
            comfortable. Check out some
            <a href="https://vimawesome.com" target="_blank">popular plugins</a> for things like autocomplete, snippets,
            and
            fuzzy finders.
            I also recommend using <a target="_blank"
                href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en">Vimium</a>
            if you want to be able to use vim mappings in the browser.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">Overall, even if you don't end up using vim
            as your primary editor, it's still a fantastic tool to have for any developer. 🛠
