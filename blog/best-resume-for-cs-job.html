            Your resume is the most important part in getting an interview, but 
            it's rather painfully overlooked by so many. Without an interview,
            you have nothing to prepare for.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Unfortunately, I physically can't get to everyone who sends me their resume 
            for a critique, but I've seen 
            so many common patterns and
            wanted to collate my suggestions into one place to hopefully help out a larger 
            group.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Bear in mind that everything I suggest is subjective! If you disagree with 
            anything I say, feel free to disregard. Alright, let's begin.
        </div>
        <div class="subheading">Structure</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            At the top of your resume you should have your name and contact information. 
            This includes:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Email</li>
                <li>Phone</li>
                <li>Any relevant links (Github, portfolio, LinkedIn)</li>
            </ul>
            You don't need things like your home address here.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section blog-section-grey">
            üí° <strong>Extra tip:</strong> You can make your LinkedIn URL more human-friendly 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/topics/6042/6054/87">here</a>.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Try to keep the header short and sweet. It shouldn't be overwhelmingly large in size, either.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Below the header, I list my education. This can also go at the bottom, but I prefer the top personally. 
            Up to you! List your school, program, and graduation date. 
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            You can optionally add your GPA and some 
            relevant courses. No need to list every technical course you've taken, though. It's expected that if you're 
            in a CS program that you'll have taken some technical courses üéì
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Below education I like to list my skills. I've seen countless ways to list skills. Here's my preference:
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section" style="margin-left: 20px">
            <strong>Proficient:</strong> A, B, C, ... <br>
            <strong>Comfortable:</strong> D, E, F, ... <br>
            <strong>Familiar:</strong> G, H, I, ...
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            I then list the skills in descending order of familiarity. This includes 
            relevant languages and frameworks, but doesn't include concepts like OOP and Data 
            Structures.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Below skills I have experience, which is the most important part!
            For each experience you list, you should have 3-4 bullet points describing what you 
            did and the impact you had. The way you phrase these bullets points is <strong>very</Strong> important!
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section blog-section-grey">
            ‚ùóÔ∏èÔ∏è If you take nothing else away from this post, remember this:
            <strong>
                You need to phrase your bullet points with an impact mindset.
            </strong>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            What does this mean? Here's an example, which one do you prefer?
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section" style="margin-left: 20px">
            <i>Option #1:</i> Worked on paralellizing API and UI builds.<br>
            <i>Option #2:</i> Reduced build time by <strong>40%+</strong> by parallelizing API and UI builds,
            saving over <strong>6 minutes</strong> per build.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            I hope you picked Option #2 üòÑ What was good about it?
            <ol class="list">
                <li>The entire focus is on the impact!</li>
                <li>Quantifying the results with the use of metrics makes the impact much more evident.</li>
                <li>Shows exactly what value was brought to the team/company.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            I know that thinking of metrics can be difficult, especially for your projects which may not be live.
            Try to think about:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Number of users</li>
                <li>Percentage gains (speed, accuracy, etc)</li>
                <li>Revenue increases/cost savings</li>
            </ul>
            Try your best to think of metrics as they really help quantify your impact and make you stand out.
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            But what if I have no experience?
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            That's totally fine as well. Check out <a href="/blog/get-programming-job-no-experience" target="_blank">
            How to Get a Programming Job with No Experience</a>.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Ok, great. Hope you got the idea.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Under experience I list some (1-2) relevant projects. If you end up using bullet points, be sure 
            to follow the same impact-minded approach I mentioned.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            That's all for structure! What do I not like to include?
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Objective statements. I think these are a little outdated and not really necessary. 
                    Your application to the job is likely enough to show your objective.
                </li>
                <li>Links to every project and coursework. Again not needed. If you have your Github or a 
                    portfolio link at the top, you're covered.
                </li>
                <li>Personal hobbies/interests. It's obviously optional, so I like to use the saved space for 
                    other things.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subheading">Formatting</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Alright, let's move on to formatting. A lot of this is preference, but there are some do's and don't's.
            I'm going to assume you have spelling and typos in order already.
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            How many pages should I have?
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Single page. No questions asked. There are not many people on this Earth who are
            qualified enough to have a two page resume (let alone four).
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            The reality is that <strong>recruiters will only spend a few seconds on your resume</strong>. They
            need to go through hundreds, if not thousands, per day. The easier you make it for them, the better your
            chances are.
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            One column or two?
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            It depends on your preference! I like to keep a single column format.
            I find it much easier to read at first sight since my eyes can follow a straight path down the page.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Two columns can work well too, just be careful to keep things clean. I'd stray away from three columns.
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            Coloured or black and white?
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            This is also subjective. In my personal opinion, I think adding a subtle amount of üåà colour can do
            wonders with helping you stand out. It definitely gives the resume a more modern feel.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            It can be very easy to overdo this. Try to keep the colour to a minimum. Definitely keep
            your main text black, but don't be afraid to add some colour into the header or subtitles.
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            Font size?
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Be sure to keep your font size readable! Around 12pt is a good reference. Your resume should 
            be as clear and easy to read as possible. Try not to make the font super small to squish in more details.
        </div>
        <div class="subheading">General Tips</div>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>Make it visually appealing.</strong> It should be pleasant to look at and read.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit the irrelevant information.</strong> Every word on your resume should serve a purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on impact.</strong> You're probably sick of me saying this by now.</li>
            </ul>

            I apologize if you reached out and I didn't have time to reply back! I hope this is helpful to 
            you üòÑ
