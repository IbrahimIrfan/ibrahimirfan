            I was 16 when I got my first coding job.
            My resume was absolutely <i>horrendous</i>.
            The only work experience I had was a job as a clerk at a grocery store. It took
            months for me to even come close to an interview.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            It's hard. I know. But if it was easy, everyone would do it!

        <div class="blog-section">
            I want to make sure that you don't make the same mistakes that I did. <i>This is exactly
                what I wish somebody had told me before I started looking for my first programming job.
            </i>
            Hopefully this saves you time and helps land you a job!

        <div class="subheading" id="resume">Your Resume</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            This is the #1 most important thing. You need a good resume. Let me answer
            some of the most common questions.
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            How many pages should I have?
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Single page. No questions asked. There are not many people on this Earth who are
            qualified enough to have a two page resume.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            The reality is that <strong>recruiters will only spend a few seconds on your resume</strong>. They
            need to go through hundreds, if not thousands, per day. The easier you make it for them, the better your
            chances are.
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            One column or two?
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            It depends on your preference! I like to keep a single column format.
            I find it much easier to read at first sight since my eyes can follow a straight path down the page.
            Two columns can work well too, just be careful to keep things clean. I'd stray away from three columns.
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            Coloured or black and white?
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            This is also subjective. In my personal opinion, I think adding a subtle amount of üåà colour can do
            wonders with helping you stand out. It definitely gives the resume a more modern feel.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            It can be very easy to overdo this. Try to keep the colour to a minimum. Definitely keep
            your main text black, but don't be afraid to add some colour into the header or subtitles.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            I'm always happy to review resumes. Just
            <a href="/contact" target="_blank">get in touch!</a>
        </div>

        <div class="subheading" id="applying">How to Apply</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            The company website is almost always the best way to apply.
            But, there are some exceptions.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            If you're a University/College student, check if your school has a job board or co-op
            program.
            This can be a great way for you to get exposure through your school.
            If you're a high school student like I was, directly emailing recruiters was
            the route I went. When you're in high school, you need people to pay
            extra attention to what you have to say since you have no education to
            back yourself up.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            In all other cases, I would just apply through the company website.
            It usually doesn't hurt to apply in multiple places as well, so don't fret
            too much!
        </div>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-img-content" src="../img/googlegif.gif" alt="Google careers website">
        </div>


        <div class="subheading" id="cover-letters">Cover Letters</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Cover letters are a <strong>huge</strong> waste of your time, in 99.9% of cases.
            It's just not worth it.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section blog-section-grey">
            If your resume isn't good enough, a cover letter likely won't get you an interview.
            If your resume is good enough, then why write a cover letter?
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Often, recruiters don't even read cover letters. It's just not worth their time.
            Especially if it looks like this.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section" style="font-family:times; margin-left:20px;">
            To Whom it May Concern, <br><br>

            I'm writing to inform you that I'm applying to the position of {POSITION}
            at {COMPANY}...
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Please don't do this! I used to. Literally. This is taken from one
            of my first job applications in 2015. Don't be me.
            If you're going to write a cover letter, just <i>write from the heart</i> ‚ù§.
            It's so refreshing to read something that sounds genuine instead of terminator-esque. ü§ñ
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            So... what are the 0.01% of cases where it might be worth it?
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Well, if you're applying to a smaller company which you genuinely like and
            dream about working at,
            it may be worth expressing that passion in a letter. But again, I try to stay far away from
            cover letters (and job postings which require them).
        </div>

        <div class="subheading" id="side-projects">Side Projects</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Side projects are the <strong>best</strong> way to get noticed when you have no experience.
            They show that you have passion, interest, and skills.
            On top of that, you get to make something!
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            The first side project that I recommend to absolutely everyone is to make a personal
            website. It can be a portfolio, a blog, an online resume, or all of the above. Why?
            <ol class="list">
                <li>It's very beginner friendly - you can get up and running in a weekend.
                    You can also host it for free using something like
                    <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>.
                </li>
                <li>You learn highly applicable web development skills. I think every
                    programmer (and non-programmer, for that matter) should learn
                    web development in some capacity.
                </li>
                <li>You get a personal website out of it! Having a good online presence can only help.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            If you're interested in some hardware,
            I've also had my
            <a href="/blog/palm-vein-authentication" target="_blank">fair share of fun</a>
            doing projects with the Raspberry Pi.
        </div>
        <div class="img-wrapper">

        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            I'd aim for having at least 2-3 projects on your resume if you don't have much work experience.
            Projects are the best substitute for job experience on your resume.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            That doesn't mean you should work on projects for the sole motive of putting them on your resume.
            Work on things you're passionate about or want to learn - it makes the process
            infinitely better when you <i>genuinely enjoy what you're doing</i>.

        <div class="subheading" id="linkedin">LinkedIn</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            If you don't have a LinkedIn profile, it would be good to make one. However, I don't think
            LinkedIn is very useful when finding your first programming job.
        </div>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-img-content" src="../img/linkedin.png" alt="LinkedIn Profile">
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            I've heard stories of people cold-messaging <i>hundreds</i> of recruiters asking for an interview.
            Personally, I think your time is better spent working on perfecting your resume. But hey,
            that's just my opinion. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Personally, I just try to keep my LinkedIn relatively up-to-date.
            There's nothing on my LinkedIn that isn't on my resume, so I typically
            don't include a link to it.
        </div>

        <div class="subheading" id="github">GitHub</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Definitely make sure you have a GitHub profile. Highlight some of your favourite projects
            and make sure you have simple README's for them.

        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-img-content" src="../img/github.png" alt="Github Profile">

        <div class="blog-section">
            The chances of a recruiter or interviewer looking through the code on your profile
            are extremely slim. But, it's nice to document your work regardless.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            I highly recommend
            the book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered/dp/076117897X"
                target="_blank">Show Your Work</a> by Austin Kleon.
            It discusses why you should show your work with others, even if you're a beginner.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Regardless, GitHub is great and you should be using it for your projects anyway.
