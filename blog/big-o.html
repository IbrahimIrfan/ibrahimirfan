        Big-O Notation
    </div>
    <div class="blog-date">June 9, 2020</div>

    <div class="blog-body">
        <div class="blog-section">
            Big-O notation is one of the most fundamental concepts to
            know for interviewing in Computer Science. It's <i>imperative</i>
            to know this like the back of your hand. It will be relevant for almost every single
            technical interview question you encounter.
        </div>
        <div class="subheading">Introduction: How can we compare algorithms?</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Let's start by asking ourselves: what's the best way to compare algorithms?
            There are many different ways to sort a list - how do we know which is best?
            We need some framework to be able to say that algorithm 1 is "better" than algorithm 2.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            First, "better" can mean many things. What do we care about? What do we want to optimize?
            Two common answers to this question are <i>readability</i> and <i>efficiency</i>.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Readability is concerned with how clean the code is. Is it well commented?
            How easy is it to make a change? Can I read it without wanting to claw my eyes out?
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Efficiency is where Big O comes in. How efficient is this code in terms of time (how long it takes to run)
            and space (the amount of memory it needs)? We want a basis to compare algorithm efficiency.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            What if we use <strong>number of lines</strong> as a basis?
            Algorithm 1 is better than Algorithm 2 because there's less lines of code.
            Well, this doesn't measure efficiency very effectively. The same algorithm can
            be implemented with drastically different line counts. I can put all my braces on new lines,
            does that make the algorithm less efficient? Clearly, this won't work.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Okay, what if we use <strong>time</strong> to compare instead?
            Algorithm 1 is better than Algorithm 2 because it runs in less time.
            This is better, but my code can run at different speeds depending on where I run it.
            If I run my code on a supercomputer, it'll run much faster than on my laptop.
            Actually, my code can take varying times to run on the same machine, depending on
            various factors like what processes are currently running. This won't work well either.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            <strong>Big-O notation</strong> gives us a method to compare
            algorithm efficiency. It asks the question,
        </div>
        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            What is the worst-case runtime of this algorithm relative to its input size?
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            To determine the Big-O complexity, we don't need to count the number of lines or time how long it takes to
            run.
            Instead, we just look at the basic steps of the algorithm.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            For example, a time complexity of <span class="code-inline">O(n<sup>2</sup>)</span> means that
            the runtime is proportional to the square of the input size <span class="code-inline">n</span>.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            This gives us a machine-independent basis to judge which algorithm is more efficient,
            in terms of both time and space.
        </div>
        <div class="subheading">The Basic Rules of Big O</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            There are some simple rules to follow when using Big O notation.
        </div>
        <div class="subheading">Rule 1: Drop the Constants</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            With Big O, we only care about <i>growth rate</i>. How does this algorithm scale as <span
                class="code-inline">n</span>
            gets very large?
        </div>



        <div class="subheading">Most Common Big-O Complexities</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            These are the most common runtimes that you'll encounter.
        </div>
        <div class="subheading">O(1) - Constant Time</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            An algorithm has a complexity of O(1) if the runtime is <strong>independent of the input size</strong>. For
            example,
        </div>
        <pre>
            <code>
  function one_plus_one() {
      return 1 + 1;
  }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <div class="blog-section">
            In this case, no matter what I pass to this function, the runtime stays constant. So, we say it has a
            complexity of <span class="code-inline">O(1)</span>.
        </div>
        <div class="subheading">O(log n) - Logarithmic Time</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            An algorithm has a complexity of <span class="code-inline">O(log n)</span> if the runtime is logarithmic to its input size. <strong>Binary
                search</strong> is the most
            common example here.
            You'll see a logarithmic runtime when you have some sort of <i>division</i> of work. In binary search, the
            search space is
            halved in every iteration.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Note that <strong>the base of the log does not matter</strong> in Big-O notation. Why? The change of base
            of a logarithm means multiplication by a constant factor. For example,
            <p>$$\log_{2}n = (\frac{1}{\log 2}) \log n$$</p>
            Similary logic applies for <span class="code-inline">log(n<sup>k</sup>)</span>.
            <p>$$\log n^k = k \log n$$</p>
            By Rule #1, we don't care about these constant factors, so we just write <span class="code-inline">O(log n)</span> without the base.
