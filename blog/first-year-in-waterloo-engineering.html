        First Year in Waterloo Engineering

        <div class="blog-section">
            I began getting lots of questions about Waterloo Engineering, so I wrote this post as a summary of my first
            year and to answer some common questions. Hope it helps!
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Itâ€™s no surprise that university is tougher than high school â€”
            thereâ€™s no denying that. I often get asked,
        </div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            Are my grades going to drop 20% from high school?
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            First, a bit of background on myself. In my first year of high school, I wasnâ€™t doing as well as I should
            have been â€” and I was fine with it. It actually took me until grade 11 to realize I had more to offer.
            Waitâ€¦ what does this have to do with
            university?
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            My point is, everyone is going to tell you that youâ€™re not going to do as well academically in university
            than you did in high school. And thatâ€™s true for the most part, it is a big jump. <strong>Your expectations
                should
                lower. But your goals donâ€™t have to.</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Thatâ€™s not to say you should approach university with the same mindset as high school. When I began to
            receive my first few assignment marks at the beginning of the year, I was seeing lower numbers, for sure.
            But, as the term went on, I began to adjust to the style, and eventually found my feet. Have faith in 
            yourself! ðŸ˜„
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Donâ€™t get me wrong, if youâ€™re struggling to adjust, it is absolutely <strong>nothing to be ashamed
                of.</strong>
            Itâ€™s
            tough to adjust to a new style of life, and itâ€™s completely normal to not get things right the first time.
            However, donâ€™t get hung up on grades; bad or good. If theyâ€™re not what you want to see, keep working hard,
            seeking help, and they will come. If they are what you want to see, be proud, but move on. Grades arenâ€™t
            everything!
        </div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            How many hours of class do you have per week?
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Hereâ€™s a sample week of my first term at Waterloo.
        </div>

        <div class="img-wrapper">

            <div class="caption">Casually ignore the soccer game</div>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            22 hours of lectures, 7 hours of tutorials, and 4 hours of labs, so roughly 33 hours per week in class. It
            sounds worse than it is - not every tutorial is worth going to (go to the ones which have mandatory quizzes,
            but if not and youâ€™re comfortable with the course material, you donâ€™t need to go). Also, SE101 was a pretty
            relaxed course.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            (2020 Update) Things calm down quite a bit in second and third year.
        </div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            How is the workload? How was your sleep schedule?
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            If you manage your time well, you can get however much sleep you want. I donâ€™t think I ever
            had to study past 10:30pm in first year, and slept 8 hours pretty much every night.
            But, <i>I cannot function without sleep</i>. I often prioritize it over my grades, so take this with a grain
            of salt. ðŸ˜´
        </div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            Is there a competitive culture?
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Honestly, going into university I thought it would be very competitive. I was definitely wrong â€” most people
            help answer your questions and share resources with the class. At least in SE, it feels like everyoneâ€™s in
            it together. For example, when thereâ€™s
            a practice exam without professor-approved solutions, we make a crowdsourced Google Doc and everyone adds
            their answers (usually pretty reliable given the amount of people in the program).
        </div>

        <div class="subheading">Motivation</div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            Do grades even matter anymore, as long as you pass?
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">In a program where most people are planning on not pursuing post-undergraduate
            studies, this gets asked a lot. Good grades donâ€™t <i>significantly</i> increase your chance of getting
            hired,
            although they definitely help.</div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            For me, I could not care less about the number on the page. But thatâ€™s not because I donâ€™t care about
            school, itâ€™s because I donâ€™t work hard to get good grades, I work hard because I want to work hard.
            Personally, I like to hold myself to a certain standard of living, and that has always included trying my
            best in school to get the most out of the experience. Tuition isn't cheap,
            might as well make the most of it. ðŸ˜€
        </div>

        <div class="subheading">Co-op</div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Probably Waterlooâ€™s biggest attraction is their emphasis on co-op. Itâ€™s a great way to gain quality, paid
            experience in your field, and graduate pretty much debt free.
        </div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            How many interviews can you expect in first year?
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Not a lot, to be honest. First years have the toughest time finding jobs, since youâ€™re the least experienced
            candidates at the university. From 50 applications, most people get expect to get around 3-5 interviews. If
            you do have previous
            job experience
            though, you could see around 10.
        </div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            What are interviews like?
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Most of my interviews were half behavioural, half technical. They typically last around 30 minutes to 1
            hour, usually beginning with getting to know you and then transitioning into coding problems. For the
            interviews I had that were online, I did actual coding, whereas in-person were mostly whiteboard problems.
            But, be prepared for technical questions. Know your algorithms and do lots of practice! If you can show the
            interviewer that you know your CS, they wonâ€™t care that youâ€™re a first year student.
        </div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            Is it hard to balance your job search with academics?
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Sometimes, yes. It takes effort to perfect your resume, apply to the right jobs, and prepare for and attend
            interviews. If you have an interview scheduled at the same time as a lecture, youâ€™re required to attend the
            interview. It also did not help that 3 of my biggest interviews were during midterm week. But plan
            accordingly, and youâ€™ll be okay.
        </div>

        <div class="subheading">Extracurriculars</div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            One substantial difference between university and high school is the sheer amount of clubs that you have to
            your disposal. Seriously â€” if you can dream up a club, chances are, your university has one.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            In the early weeks I joined a student design team, Waterloop, doing back-end software development. If you
            find a design team that you like at your school, try it out! Theyâ€™re slightly different from clubs â€” theyâ€™re
            more technical and project based. Itâ€™s a great experience to learn new things, meet people in different
            programs and years, and collectively work towards a goal. For us, that goal was creating a pod to compete in
            SpaceXâ€™s Hyperloop competition.

        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Later in the term, I also joined fustal (aka indoor soccer) intramurals with some friends (shoutout to Nuts
            and Bolts). Intramurals is an awesome way to relieve stress and get involved with sports. Letâ€™s ignore the
            fact that we lost every game, thoughâ€¦
        </div>

        <div class="subheading">Social Life</div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            Is the social life at Waterloo / in Engineering really that bad?
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Itâ€™s really not! Itâ€™s easy to make friends, especially if you have a cohort (which all Engineering
            programs at Waterloo do). Most people are pretty friendly and outgoing, and there are many social events
            going on throughout the term, such as the Math and Engineering Semi-Formals.

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            How are the residence communities?
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Personally, I had a great experience. I stayed at NRB (now called CMH), and had an amazing time. Everyone on
            my floor was friendly, and it was definitely sad to see it end. If you can live on residence in your first
            year, I recommend it! Just be ready to get sick of caf food pretty quickly.

        <div class="subheading">Tips and Final Remarks</div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <i>Go to your lectures</i>, at least until you know you can manage without them. But youâ€™re paying
                    for them regardless, so why not?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Donâ€™t doubt yourself.</i> Youâ€™ll be surrounded by even more high achieving students than in high
                    school. Just remember youâ€™re just as capable (the university admitted you for a reason), and itâ€™s
                    not a competition regardless.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Enjoy what youâ€™re learning.</i> If you donâ€™t enjoy it, whatâ€™s the point, really?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Take care of yourself.</i> Sleep, exercise, and eat well. It makes a huge difference. Your health
                    (physical and mental) is most important.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            All in all, university is one of the most exciting times in your life. You meet many new people and have a
            new sense of independence. Although the academics can be overwhelming at times, donâ€™t forget to have fun!
