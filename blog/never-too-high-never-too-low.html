            The 2015-2016 Premier League season was nothing short of a miracle.
            It's commonly denoted as the greatest sporting story of all time.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            On May 2, 2016, Leicester City were crowned champions of the top division of English football (soccer). A few months
            prior, this was unthinkable. If you were to go back in time
            to the beginning of the season and tell anyone
            that Leicester
            would win the title, they'd probably think
            you're high.

            If anyone was crazy enough to actually believe you, bookkeepers
            were offering betting odds of <strong>5000-1</strong>, or a 1/5000 chance, for Leicester to win it all.
            If you bet $1, your payout would be $5001.
            To put this into perspective,
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            The chances of
            Kanye West becoming U.S. President in 2020, at time of writing, is 1/66.

        <div class="blog-section">
            The chances that you were born with each eye a different

            The chances that you will be struck by lighting in your lifetime

        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            The chances for Leicester to win the title were 1/5000. And on May 2, 2016,
            many bookmakers had to fork over millions of dollars in payouts. So much so,
            that some vowed to never offer odds as high as 5000-1 <strong>ever again.</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            So, an underdog won something? What's the big whoop?
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Well, there was something about the way the Leicester players and manager
            handled the season that still reasonates with me in my day-to-day life.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            You see, about 1-2 months into the season, Leicester were remarkably
            still first in the league. Everyone expected it to just be luck, and
            for them to fall down the table any game now. I <i>very clearly</i>
            remember thinking the same thing to myself.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            But, Leicester kept winning. I will always remember the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aELCVt9oIFY" target="_blank">antics</a>
            of
            Claudio Ranieri, the manager at the time.
            At the beginning of the season, he set out the goal for Leicester
            to achieve 40 points. This would have had them finish 17<sup>th</sup> out of 20, just
            barely avoiding relegation. A reasonable goal for their expectations.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            After each game they won, until they reached the 40 point mark,
            the post-match interviewer would <i>always</i> ask,
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            Surely, it's time to start targeting more than 40 points now?
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            And, sure enough, Claudio Ranieri would <i>always</i> respond with something like this,
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            40 points. I canâ€™t change our project at the moment. Our goal right now is to maintain the Premier
            League. Be solid with two feet firmly on the floor. 40 points.
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Even when they were 1 win away from their target, the goal stayed the same.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            And, of course, they reached the 40 point target midway through the season.
            Even then, he and the team would
            always stay composed.
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            The title is yours to win! How does it feel to be so close?
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            No matter how much they won, how close they got to
            the title, the team never let it get in their heads.
            Their responses were always along the lines of,
        </div>
        <blockquote>
            Just taking it one game at a time, and whatever happens, happens.
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            It was quite remarkable. At times, it seemed like they couldn't care
            less about the end result. They were just doing their job, one
            game at a time. Just completely unfazed by the media, attention, and
            pressure.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Perhaps the one response which the players gave to
            reporters post-match that stuck with me the most was
            <strong>never get too high, never get too low</strong>.
            This idea that, if things are going stupendously, be happy,
            but move on. If things aren't going your way,
            it's okay to be sad, but move on.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            After every win and loss, the ability to stay <i>so immensly
                level-headed</i> has stuck with me ever since.
            Even if you have no interest in sports whatsoever,
            we can all take something away from Leicester's accomplishment.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            I started University in 2017, one year after Leicester won the title.
            Since then, there's been countless ups and downs.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Good grades, bad grades.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Good jobs, bad jobs.

        <div class="blog-section">
            Good people, bad people.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Maybe I'm weird to think in this manner,
            but I've been relatively happy with how I've been able to stay in control
            emotionally when times get hectic. I think it's a
            generally a
            good way to go about life.

        <div class="blog-section">
            A big example of this is when internship recruiting season comes around, 
            typically coinciding with midterm exams.
            I try to
            keep things as private as possible. Sometimes, this is unavoidable, but I
            try to nonetheless.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            I don't even tell my parents until the very end.
            When I was in the final stages with Google, my
            mom asked me,
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            <blockquote>
                "So, when are you starting to apply for your next co-op?".
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Whoops.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            It's not that I don't like to tell them things.
            It's just easier for me to stay level-headed without all
            of the extra eyes.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            The Google interview process is a bit of a hot mess.
            It took over 4 months, including 5 total interviews.
            Each one was a roller coaster, and going through it in
            private was a big way that I was able to keep my emotions in check.
            Day-by-day, interview-by-interview. Whatever happens, happens.

        <div class="blog-section">
            I was happy to come home with good news the following week.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Leicester finished the season with 81 points, a Premier League title, and
            the greatest sports miracle of all time.
