        The Wonderfully Weird World of Freelancing

            My time as a freelancer was short. Very short. About 1 year, in fact.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            In that very short year, I ended up in 3 very different <i>bizzare</i> scenarios.
            So much so that I feel it's worthy of it's own writeup.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Freelancing can be fantastic. You get a lot of benefits, namely,
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    You are your own boss.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can make your own schedule.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can work from anywhere.
                </li>
            </ul>

            But wait... this sounds great! What could <span class="very-big">POSSIBLY</span> go wr-

        <div class="subheading">Client #1</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Let's meet our first client. Since popular freelance sites like <a href="www.upwork.com"
                target="_blank">UpWork</a> were, and still probably are,
            out of my league,
            I had to resort to finding listings on Craigslist and Kijiji.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            After 15 minutes of searching, I stumbled across a suitable posting and reached out.
            The job was to do some simple web and mobile design for a small business.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            We hop on the phone, talk about requirements, and a week later I sent over the final revision.
            I get paid the day after, and all is well! My first client, what a great feeling!
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            I know, wholesome, right? Just wait.
        </div>
