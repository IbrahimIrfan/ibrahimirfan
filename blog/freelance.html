        The Wonderfully Weird World of Freelancing
    </div>
    <div class="blog-date">June 8, 2020</div>

    <div class="blog-body">
        <div class="blog-section">
            My time as a freelancer was short. Very short. About 1 year, in fact.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            In that very short year, I ended up in 3 very <i>bizzare</i> scenarios.
            So much so that I feel it's worthy of it's own writeup.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Freelancing can be fantastic. You get a lot of benefits, namely,
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    You are your own boss.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can make your own schedule.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can work from anywhere.
                </li>
            </ul>

            But wait... this sounds great! What could <span class="very-big">POSSIBLY</span> go wr-
        </div>

        <div class="subheading">Client #1</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Let's meet our first client. Since popular freelance sites like <a href="www.upwork.com"
                target="_blank">UpWork</a> were, and still probably are,
            out of my league,
            I had to resort to finding listings on Craigslist and Kijiji. The bowels of internet classified.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            After 15 minutes of searching, I stumbled across a suitable posting and reached out.
            The job was to do some simple web and mobile design for a small business.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            We hop on the phone, talk about requirements, and a week later I sent over the final revision.
            I get paid the day after, and all is well! My first client, what a great feeling!
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            I know, wholesome, right? Just wait.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Fast forward 6 months. I have a small break from school, and reach out to Client #1 to see if they have any
            work I can pick up. You know, ðŸŒˆ <i>building relationships</i> and all.
        </div>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-img-content" src="../img/email1.png" alt="The first email">
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Soon enough, I get a response.
        </div>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-img-content" src="../img/email2.png" alt="The second email">
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Uh, okay. Gotta cut the numbers in half. Maybe their company is having a sale?
            You know, how retailers <i>say</i> that the clothes are 50% off, but really
            they just doubled the original price? Yeah, that's probably it.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            I open the picture, and see...
        </div>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-img-content" src="../img/paystub.png" alt="Paystub">
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            ... a paystub. A paystub for an employee of Client #1's business. And I'm supposed to cut all the numbers in
            half?
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Now, I'm no accountant, but... does Client #1 want me to help them commit <span class="very-big">TAX
                FRAUD?</span>
            Turns out <a href="https://paystubmakr.com/blog/why-fake-pay-stubs-are-illegal" target="_blank">pay stub
                fraud</a>
            is actually quite common - and most definitely illegal.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            At this point, I'm in a tough situation. Do I refuse to do this work and lose a client,
            which don't come easy for a freelancer just starting out? I definitely wasn't prepared to be an accomplice,
            that's for sure.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            I didn't know what to do. Am I obliged to report this? I had plans the following week, and jail would make
            attending a bit complicated.
            So, the next day, I went to <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~drayside/" target="_blank">Derrek
                Rayside's</a>
            office in confusion.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            After about 30 minutes of wondering and researching the <a
                href="https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html" target="_blank">IEEE Code of
                Ethics</a>, we came to the conclusion that
            I was not obligated to report this and I should probably stop working with this client.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            And that was the last of Client #1.
        </div>

        <div class="subheading">Client #2</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Ah, Client #2. Fresh off the disappointment of Client #1, I was excited to work with Client #2.
            The posting seemed right up my alley.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            After some initial exchanges, I get a <i>really long</i> email. I've removed the uninteresting parts.
        </div>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-img-content" src="../img/client2_email.png" alt="Client 2 First Email">
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Clearly, this person did not realize that I'm a student. But, the more interesting thing happened when I
            clicked on
            the Google Drive link.
        </div>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-img-content" src="../img/folder.png" alt="Client 2 Folder">
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            I kid you not, there was a document in the <span class="code-inline">Mockups</span> folder called <span
                class="code-inline">Passwords</span>. Naturally, I opened it (with no malicious intent, right Client
            #1?).
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Sure enough, <i>every single password</i> you could dream of was in this document. Bank accounts, passport
            information,
            their SSN, social media passwords - the whole lot.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Why was this in a public mockups folder? How many people has Client #2 shared this with? Why is their
            Twitter password <span class="code-inline">yetanotherpassword</span>? And why did they need to write that
            down to remember it?
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            To whomever is reading this, <a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">please use a password
                manager</a>.
            Don't be Client #2.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Yes, I did let them know about the password document. No, I didn't end up being the CTO of the next Uber.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            That was the last of Client #2. A true classic.
        </div>


        <div class="subheading">Client #3</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            My personal favourite. I found the posting from this client deep in the depths of Craigslist.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            I sent over my resume, and got a response. Backend work for a "popular website".
            Finally, a normal client! And for a high-traffic website - this would be a great experience.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Then, I saw their email.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <span class="code-inline">vodka.casino@randomdomain.com</span>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Sigh. What now? Have I not been through enough?
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            I couldn't find anything particular online when I searched for <span class="code-inline">Vodka
                Casino</span>,
            so I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. I got another email with project details.
        </div>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-img-content" src="../img/vodka-email.png" alt="Project details email from vodka casino">
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            I opened <span class="code-inline">instructions.pdf</span>. The first line caught me by surprise:
        </div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            When I type <span class="code-inline">[CENSORED]</span>ðŸ”ž in the search bar, it should...
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Wait, what? Why would someone search for <span class="code-inline">[CENSORED]</span>ðŸ”ž ? Unless...
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Yup. Sure enough, <strong>I had been hired to work on an adult film website</strong>.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            At this point I had decided I could not work on this. But, curiosity did strike me... how much does this
            industry even pay?
            I might as well get some information for my troubles, after all.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            I tried to get a quote, but was met with a request to talk over the phone. I wasn't willing to have my phone
            number out in the adult film industry. Besides, how would I even address this person?
        </div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            Hi Vodka, how are you?
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Or,
        </div>

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            Good afternoon, Mr. Casino.
        </blockquote>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Clearly, a phone call wasn't going to happen. That was the last of Client #3, and is the story of my
            brief career in the adult film industry.
        </div>

            My freelancing experience was eventful to say the least.
