            Preparing for coding interviews can be very overwhelming.
            There's so much to study... where to even begin?
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            The mistake many people make is that they study all of the data structures 
            and algorithms in the world, but they don't study <strong>how to interview</strong>.
            It's not all about solving hundreds of Leetcode questions until your brain melts.

            These are the 6 steps I use in <i>every single interview</i>.

        <div class="blog-section">
            I don't care if you've done the problem before. I don't care
            if you're the best engineer in the world.
            I don't care if you already solved the problem in your head
            as it's being explained.
            The very first thing you
            need to do is <strong>restate the problem</strong>.

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            But... why? The problem is easy! You just need to...

        <div class="blog-section">
            There are so many benefits to such a trivial thing.
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    It instantly starts your interview with
                    mutual understanding. Communication is one of
                    the most important things that you're being evaluated on.
                    This shows your interviewer that you care about properly
                    understanding problems without rushing into them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you're blanking out and have no idea where to start, it helps
                    calm your nerves and gets you thinking in the right track.
                    No really - it does.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quite simply, it makes sure you understood the question right!
                </li>
            </ul>
            I have a really easy framework that I use. It takes ~10 seconds.
        </div>
        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            So, we want a function that takes in X and returns Y based on Z
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            For example, if the question is to find if a pair in an array of numbers
            sums to 0,

        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            So, we want a function that takes in <strong>an array of numbers</strong>

            true or false </strong>based on<strong> whether or not there's a pair that
            sums to 0</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            That's it. Yup. That's it.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Step 1: ✅
        </div>
        <div class="subheading" id="step2">Step 2: Ask Questions</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Another extremely important step that can be very easy to forget.
            Before you code, you have to ask questions. Think about:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Edge cases (really big and really small numbers)</li>
                <li>Special cases (like empty strings/arrays, null params, repetition, etc)</li>
                <li>What you should optimize for (time, space, readability)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Continuing the last example, I would ask:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Can there be positive/negative numbers in the array?</li>
                <li>Is the array sorted?</li>
                <li>Can numbers repeat?</li>
                <li>Can I assume that adding two numbers together won't overflow a
                    standard int?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            I cannot tell you how many times I have had interviewers withhold
            important information to a question which I only uncovered by asking about it.
            Had I not, I would have done the question much differently.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            If you get good at this step, it can save you a world of problems and definitely
            gives you bonus points for good communication.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Step 2: ✅
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Now we can <span class="very-big">FINALLY</span> start coding, right? Right?
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Wrong!
        </div>
        <div class="subheading" id="step3">Step 3: State Brute Force</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Still no coding. The next thing you should do is state the brute force solution (and ideally it's
            complexity).
            This is the most basic solution, often acheived by just trying every possible outcome (hence "brute force").
            <strong>You should only state this solution - do not code it!</strong>
        </div>
        <blockquote class="blog-section">
            But why? The brute force solution sucks! It'll make me look bad!
        </blockquote>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Glad you asked!
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            It won't make you look bad - you're not saying "this is the best solution!", you're just stating
            the first solution that comes to mind.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section blog-section-grey">
            If you take nothing else away from this section, remember this: you're being judged on your
            <strong>problem solving skills</strong>. Not how quickly you can come up with the best solution.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            By stating the brute force solution, you give yourself a starting point. Often times,
            the most optimal answer can come by directly improving inefficiencies in the brute force.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            For our array example, the brute force approach would be to just check every single pair in the array for one
            that sums to 0. We have <span class="code-inline">O(n<sup>2</sup>)</span> pairs, so this would run in
            <span class="code-inline">O(n<sup>2</sup>)</span>.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Psst! If you want to learn more about Big O, or just refresh your knowledge, check out
            <a href="/blog/big-o" target="_blank">The Complete Guide to Big O Notation</a>.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Once you've stated the brute force solution, you're done this step.
            Not so bad so far, right?
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            Step 3: ✅
        </div>
        <div class="subheading" id="step4">Step 4: Optimize</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Welcome to the hardest step! Now that we have a starting point (the brute force), we want to find the most
            optimal solution.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            This is the hardest step because there's no step-by-step guaranteed way to get the most optimal solution.
            There are only strategies to help you along the way. And quite frankly, that's all you need!

            I've passed many interviews in which I did not get the most optimal answer. If you show your interviewer
            that you have good problem solving skills, and you get a reasonable answer with justification, you'll be
            golden. ⭐
            Here's my process:
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Identify the type of problem - is this question about strings, graphs, dynamic programming?</li>
                <li>Recall strategies used to solve these kinds of problems. For example, if I have a graph problem,
                    can I use BFS or DFS in any way to help me? For dynamic programming, can I use a memoization table?
                </li>
                <li>Refer to the details of the question for hints - does the data given to you have a particular
                    order or property that can help you make assumptions?
                </li>
                <li>If that doesn't work, can I transform this into a different kind of problem?</li>
            </ol>
            Honestly, this comes with practice. You need to solve questions yourself to get a sense of what strategies
            work and when.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> ask your interviewer as you're thinking out loud if you're on the right track.
            If you are, they'll tell you, and if you're not, you might get a hint out of it. Remember - an interview is
            supposed to be collaborative.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Once you find an algorithm you like, quickly check with your interviewer before starting to code.

            Now we can finally start coding! Some tips:
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Keep it clean - it goes a long way. Print neatly if you're on a whiteboard and leave a line or two
                    of
                    space inbetween just in case you need to add something. And please, use good variable names.
                </li>
                <li>Don't worry about being perfect the first time. No one does this on the job, it's an iterative
                    process.</li>
                <li>Make sure you know how to use common data structures in the language of your choice. This includes
                    hash maps, hash sets, stacks, and others. You should also know the runtime of the common operations
                    on
                    these structures.

        <div class="blog-section">
            You've written your code - all that's left is to test.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            The biggest piece of advice I can give you here is to test your <strong>code</strong>,
            not your <strong>algorithm</strong>. Go through the exact code you wrote down. This 
            is especially important in whiteboard interviews where you can't run your code.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Run through some good test cases. What makes a good test case?
        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            For starters, you don't need to test the same thing twice. Each test case should serve 
            a specific purpose. Use your best judgment and make sure you've got your edge cases covered!

            Step 6: ✅
        </div>
        <div class="subheading" id="tips">General Tips</div>
        <div class="blog-section">
            Some general tips to help you,
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>Talk out loud.</strong> Your interviewer is looking to 
                    evaluate your problem solving skills. If you don't 
                    talk, it shows very little about your process. 
                    Also, if you're talking through your 
                    thoughts while you're stuck, they can nudge you in the 
                    right direction.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Slow down.</strong> It's better to take your time than 
                    furiously rewrite your code.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Be honest when you don't know.</strong> 
                    In one of my Google interviews, I got stuck very 
                    early on in a question. Being honest when I was stuck 
                    rather than pretending I knew exactly what to do was 
                    the reason I was able to pass that interview (and eventually 
                    get the offer).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Draw diagrams.</strong> Graphs, linked lists, and stacks all pose 
                    great opportunities to let your inner artist shine.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Be confident!</strong> You got this 😃 Worst case, you 
                    don't get the job, and that's okay!
                </li>
