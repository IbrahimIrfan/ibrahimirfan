Overall scores for competitors are determined by an interview and multiple-choice exam; we did great on the interviews, but lacked on the exams. <br><br> Since the exams that DECA releases are not in a user-friendly format, it was a hassle to practice, and it hindered our success. Not only that, our club was doing registration for over 200 members by hand.<br><br>Thus, I decided to completely redo our existing website, creating a program would read the practice exams that DECA releases and output self-marking online forms. I then implemented a registration and login system for members to take those exams under their name on our website; allowing the executives to monitor their progress.<br><br> Other functionality included executive-only announcement posting (along with email notifications once an announcement is posted), as well as other resources for each event.",

The x-axis controls pitch modulation to produce a vibrato, so by shaking your right hand side to side, you can create a sound that mimics the human voice.<br><br> This hands-free system has a game mode and free play mode. In game mode, you can follow the purple bar depicted on the screen to play some of your favorite songs, whereas in free play, you are free to create and practice. You can also create and upload your own songs for others to play and enjoy. <br><br>It is great for people who cannot play an instrument due to disorders like arthritis or Parkinsons. Additionally, it is helpful for developing fine motor skills, as a therapeutic medium, or to help with ear training, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",
